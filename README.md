#MIUI V8 Swedish translation#

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just started this project 2016-11-22 since the crowdin one isnt going anywhere + ridicilus personal information needed to join as a contributor.

IÂ´ll focus on the interface along with settings and then most used apps such as alarm/clock, calculator, camera, gallery, dialer,
contacts, messages, filexplorer, video, weather. Then rest of the apps will come in due time :)


Dont hesitate to contact me if you have any issues or questions about the translation - tndb82@gmail.com

Update 2016-12-30 - Ive returned to vanilla android again (JDCteams 7.1.1) and unfortunately I dont have a spare xiaomi phone where I can doublecheck translations etc which means little progress for the time being. I will most probably take up the translation again if/when xiaomi releases the mini Mi S phone but if you wanna continue my work then send me a mail and ill invite you into the project
